In this course, students develop React applications using JavaScript and JSX tags. They examine the

Students create single-page applications that utilize data binding, the React router library and are
based on components and JSX. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to create modern
single page applications utilizing the React framework to solve a specific development need.
